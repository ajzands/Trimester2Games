    <h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> The Maze </h1>

 <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> This is the third game I created. It is a type of maze game, where you control a character, and you, using WASD or Arrow Keys, guide your character from the green start square to the red victory square. You have 3 lives to complete the level, but be sure to pay attention, your momentum stays with you until you die or win!</p>

<p style="color:SlateBlue;"> Time Worked On: 2 weeks </p>

<p style="color:Violet;"> In this game, I learned how to create a grid to place specific sprites into the positions I want. I learned how to give a sprite momentum so it continues moving even after input from the user has stopped.  </p>

<p style="color:Tomato;"> My next challenge I want to tackle is to create a game with audio effects to add more depth to it, the game itself may not be the most complex, but I want to find audio that'll match it well and use that audio to make the game better. </p>
