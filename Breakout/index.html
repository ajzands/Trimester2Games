  <h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> Breakout </h1>

 <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> This is the second game I created this trimester. It was a remake of the classic game Breakout. In this game, you control a paddle, which you use to keep the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. You gain points by hitting the bricks at the top of the screen, and when all the bricks on the screen are cleared, you go to the next level. </p>

<p style="color:SlateBlue;"> Time Worked On: 1 week, 4 days </p>

<p style="color:Violet;"> With breakout, I learned how to create sprites, learn to create and use collision detection from p5.play, how to create text and levels, and how to make a game reset using functions. </p>

<p style="color:Tomato;"> My next challenge will be to create a maze type of game, where the character has to go from one area to another, but when the character is moved it will cause for some sort of velocity or gravity increase to make the game more challenging. </p>
