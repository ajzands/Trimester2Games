## Welcome to Avery's Trimester 2 Game Library

This trimester we began with the assignment to complete 5 games by the end of the trimester. This website is the library of all of the games I create during this time.

## Breakout: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Breakout/

## Maze: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Maze/

This is the third game I created. It is a type of maze game, where you control a character, and you, using WASD or Arrow Keys, guide your character from the green start square to the red victory square. You have 3 lives to complete the level, but be sure to pay attention, your momentum stays with you until you die or win!
