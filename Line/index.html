  <h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> Linetap </h1>

  <p style="color:Tomato;"> This is the first game I created called Linetap, in Linetap, a line moves across the screen. As time ticks down, you must click on the line, for points and more time. The bigger darker blue area gives 1 point, and increases time by 1 second, and the smaller bar in the middle adds 5 points and increases the time by 3 seconds. </p>

<p style="color:Tomato;"> Time Worked On: 3 days </p>

<p style="color:Tomato;"> With the creation of Linetap, I learned about how to constrain objects or sprites in a game, as well as how to create boundaries for the game itself. </p>

<p style="color:Tomato;"> My next challenge will be to try and recreate an old game like Breakout to see if I can create a simple game like it, and possibly add my own aspects to it. </p>
