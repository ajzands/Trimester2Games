<h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> Deposit </h1>

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> This is the fourth game I created. It is a maze, where you must collect coins and deposit them to win. You use WASD or the Arrow Keys to move your character. You start at the Blue square, and deposit into the green bank square. You have 3 lives so make sure to stay alive as long as you can to try and beat the game! </p>

<p style="color:SlateBlue;"> Time Worked On: 1 week 4 days </p>

<p style="color:Violet;"> In this game, I learned how to gain better control of my grid, Create a function to carry items, and how to add sounds to my games.

<p style="color:Tomato;"> Because it is the end of the trimester, I am not sure what I am going to be doing next, but I am brainstorming for the future.
