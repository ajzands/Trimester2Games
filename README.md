## Welcome to Avery's Trimester 2 Game Library

This trimester we began with the assignment to complete 5 games by the end of the trimester. This website is the library of all of the games I create during this time.

## Linetap: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Line/

## Breakout: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Breakout/

This is the second game I created this trimester. It was a remake of the classic game Breakout. In this game, you control a paddle, which you use to keep the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. You gain points by hitting the bricks at the top of the screen, and when all the bricks on the screen are cleared, you go to the next level.

Time Worked On: 1 week, 4 days

With breakout, I learned how to create sprites, learn to create and use collision detection from p5.play, how to create text and levels, and how to make a game reset using functions.

My next challenge will be to create a maze type of game, where the character has to go from one area to another, but when the character is moved it will cause for some sort of velocity or gravity increase to make the game more challenging.

## Maze: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Maze/

This is the third game I created. It is a type of maze game, where you control a character, and you, using WASD or Arrow Keys, guide your character from the green start square to the red victory square. You have 3 lives to complete the level, but be sure to pay attention, your momentum stays with you until you die or win!
