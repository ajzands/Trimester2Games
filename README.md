## Welcome to Avery's Trimester 2 Game Library

This trimester we began with the assignment to complete 5 games by the end of the trimester. This website is the library of all of the games I create during this time.

## Linetap: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Line/

This is the first game I created called Linetap, in Linetap, a line moves across the screen. As time ticks down, you must click on the line, for points and more time. The bigger darker blue area gives 1 point, and increases time by 1 second, and the smaller bar in the middle adds 5 points and increases the time by 3 seconds.

## Breakout: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Breakout/

This is the second game I created this trimester. It was a remake of the classic game Breakout. In this game, you control a paddle, which you use to keep the ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. You gain points by hitting the bricks at the top of the screen, and when all the bricks on the screen are cleared, you go to the next level.

## Maze: https://ajzands.github.io/Trimester2Games/Maze/

This is the third game I created. It is a type of maze game, where you control a character, and you, using WASD or Arrow Keys, guide your character from the green start square to the red victory square. You have 3 lives to complete the level, but be sure to pay attention, your momentum stays with you until you die or win!
